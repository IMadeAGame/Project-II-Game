--CONTROLS--
	UP -> Jump, Climb up ladders
	LEFT/RIGHT -> Walk left/right, Climb left/right ladders
	DOWN -> Climb down ladders
	SHIFT -> Bash
	ESC -> Go to title screen
--NOTES ON TWO VERSIONS--
	I have two versions of the game, "Temple of Treasure Game" does not have all levels beaten, I included a copy called, 
	"Temple of Treasure Game BEATEN" that has all levels marked as completed. This is so that anyone can access the final
	boss at any time if needed.
